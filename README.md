# Compilation instructions

To initialize the project run: 

`mkdir build`

`cd build`

`cmake ..`

This will initialize the make file and download Raylib. This is only needed to be done once.

To compile the code, make sure that you are in the build directory and run `make`. Then run the program with `./line_tracker`
